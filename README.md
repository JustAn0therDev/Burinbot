# Burinbot
A Discord bot for gathering anime and manga information. Made using C# .NET Core (migrating to .NET 5).

I did not make a bot for profit. This is project is just for fun with an open source code for whoever feels like creating a bot of their own
or forking/cloning this one and adapting the code to their own Discord Bot App.

The My Anime List API used is an unofficial Web API and there is no intent of copyright infringement and things alike. Their docs
can be found in the link:

Please note that you will have to have a "token.txt" on the top-level directory of the project containing ONLY an OAuth 2.0 token from Discord for it to work and "login" to the platform.
