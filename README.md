# Burinbot
A Discord bot for gathering anime and manga information. Made using C# .NET Core.

I did not make a bot for profit. This is project is just for fun with an open source code for whoever feels like creating a bot of their own
or forking/cloning this one and adapting the code to their own Discord Bot App. To clone the project and adapt it, 
please keep in mind which IDE will be used since the configurations of a .NET Core application (and pretty much others) can vary from IDE to IDE.

The My Anime List API that is called is an unofficial API and there is no intent of copyright infringement and things alike. Their docs
can be found in the link:

Please contact me if there's anything you would have done differently or if you wanna work on the same project with me, I will be happy 
to help.
